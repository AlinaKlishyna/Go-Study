# 🐹 Learning Go

Hi! I’m **Alina**, a Java developer diving into **Go (Golang)**.  
I’m learning step by step — from basic syntax to building APIs.

## 🌱 Current focus
- Variables, functions, and structs  
- Pointers & methods  
- Slices, maps, and strings  

## 🎯 Goal
Build clean and practical backend projects in Go.

> Simple. Fast. Go.
